# Joint Savings Account


This projects uses Remix (Ethereum IDE ) to create smart contracts for a startup fintech company. The smart contracts will be used to automate the creation of joint savinds accounts. The Solidity smart contract will accept two user addresses. These addresses will be able to control a joint savings account. The contracts use ether management functions to implement a financial institution's requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account.
